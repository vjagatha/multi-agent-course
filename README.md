## Recommended Resource

If you'd like to deepen your understanding of building LLM applications, refer to this book:

[**Build LLM Applications from Scratch**](https://www.manning.com/books/build-llm-applications-from-scratch)

---

## How to Use This Repo

- This repo contains supplemental content for the course. Content is organized **week by week**, aligned with live sessions and project milestones.
- **Google Colab Pro** is the preferred environment for running notebooks.
- You may also **clone the repo locally** and run notebooks using Jupyter or your IDE.
- Each notebook includes its own dependencies via `!pip install` — there is **no global `requirements.txt`**.

---

## Cloning the Repository (Optional)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/enterprise-rag-agents.git
cd enterprise-rag-agents
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```
